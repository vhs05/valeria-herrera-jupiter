    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Valeria Herrera, a current sophomore at Rhodes College. I am majoring in Business and I hope to minor in either Economics or Statistics. I think programming is a great skill to know because it helps you develop rudimentary skills like logical thinking and problem-solving. I am also highly interested in Data Analytics, so I hope that these skills can help further my professional career in the long-term.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Economics 100, Computer Programming 141, Financial Accounting</li>
    <li>Coursera Google IT Support Fundamentals Certification</li>
